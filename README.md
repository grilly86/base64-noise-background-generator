# base64-noise-background-generator

Small web tool to generate noise image backgrounds and provide the result as base64 string for usage in CSS files.

See in action: http://codeblock.at/base64-noise-generator/

Further information: [spectrum.js](https://github.com/bgrins/spectrum) and [FontAwesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome) have been removed from the folder structure, you'll have to add it separately if you want in order to work correctly.

@todo: add perlin noise function for more controlled noises.
